Project Overview
The ALX Files Manager is a simple platform to:

Authenticate users using tokens.
Upload, view, and manage files with access permissions.
Generate image thumbnails in the background.
This project is a hands-on summary of backend topics taught during the trimester, providing practical experience in building a fully functional product.

Features
User Authentication: Secure login and token-based authentication.
File Management:
List all files uploaded by a user.
Upload new files.
Change file permissions (e.g., read-only, read/write).
View/download files.
Thumbnails Generation: Automatic thumbnail creation for image uploads.
Pagination: Efficient listing of files with pagination.
Background Processing: Offload resource-heavy tasks like thumbnail generation.
Tech Stack
Node.js: Server-side runtime for JavaScript.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user and file metadata.
Redis: In-memory data store for caching and task queues.
Express.js: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
Bull: Queue library for handling background jobs.
JWT: JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
Sharp: Library for image processing and thumbnail generation.

Background Jobs
This project uses Bull for handling background tasks like generating image thumbnails. The tasks are managed using Redis.

Worker Location: workers/thumbnailWorker.js
Start the worker:
bash
Copy code
node workers/thumbnailWorker.js
Testing
